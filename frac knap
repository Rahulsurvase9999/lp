Knapsack Problem : Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine a subset of
items to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the
total value is as large as possible. The knapsack problem is in combinatorial optimization problem.
It appears as a subproblem in many, more complex mathematical models of real-world problems.
One general approach to difficult problems is to identify the most restrictive constraint, ignore the
others, solve a knapsack problem, and somehow adjust the solution to satisfy the ignored
constraints. The fractional knapsack problem is also one of the techniques which are used to solve
the knapsack problem. In fractional knapsack, the items are broken in order to maximize the profit.
The problem in which we break the item is known as a Fractional knapsack problem.
Greedy approach: In Greedy approach, we calculate the ratio of profit/weight, and accordingly,
we will select the item. The item with the highest ratio would be selected first.
The same approach we are using in our program.
 We have taken an array of structures named Item.
 Each Item has value & weight.
 We are calculating density= value/weight for each item and sorting the items array in
the order of decreasing density.
 We add values from the top of the array to totalValue until the bag is full
i.e. totalValue<=W ( where W is Knapsack weight).

There are basically three approaches to solve the problem:
 The first approach is to select the item based on the maximum profit.
 The second approach is to select the item based on the minimum weight.
 The third approach is to calculate the ratio of profit/weight.

Fractional Knapsack Problem using python
# Structure for an item which stores weight and
# corresponding value of Item
class Item:
	def __init__(self, profit, weight):
		self.profit = profit
		self.weight = weight

# Main greedy function to solve problem
def fractionalKnapsack(W, arr):

	# Sorting Item on basis of ratio
	arr.sort(key=lambda x: (x.profit/x.weight), reverse=True) 

	# Result(value in Knapsack)
	finalvalue = 0.0

	# Looping through all Items
	for item in arr:

		# If adding Item won't overflow, 
		# add it completely
		if item.weight <= W:
			W -= item.weight
			finalvalue += item.profit

		# If we can't add current Item, 
		# add fractional part of it
		else:
			finalvalue += item.profit * W / item.weight
			break
	
	# Returning final value
	return finalvalue


# Driver Code
if __name__ == "__main__":
	W = 50
	arr = [Item(60, 10), Item(100, 20), Item(120, 30)]

	# Function call
	max_val = fractionalKnapsack(W, arr)
	print(max_val)
